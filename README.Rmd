## Overview

A repository hosting (a work-in-progress for) the digitised and curated dataset of the Holle List vocabularies of languages off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia [@holle1987; @holleli1980]. The goal is to allow computational matching between the vocabularies of these languages with the [main, digitised Holle List](https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/) [@rajeg2023]. The matching will provide the English, Dutch, and Indonesian translations for these vocabularies that are carried over from the main Holle List.

To current [citation](https://github.com/complexico/holle-list-barrier-islands/blob/main/CITATION.cff) for this repository is as follows:

> Rajeg, G. P. W., & Arka, I. W. (2025). The digitised and annotated Holle List of the Barrier Islands languages, off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia [Data set]. https://github.com/complexico/holle-list-barrier-islands https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P8A3R

Please also cite the original sources in Stokhof [-@holleli1980] and Stokhof and Almanar [-@holle1987].

### Notes

- Files in the `plaintexts` directory below have been digitised and manually checked:

    - lekon.txt (✅)
    
    - simalur.txt (✅)
    
    - tapah.txt (✅)
    
    - mentawai1933.txt (✅)

These files will be supplemented by the additional data from the neighbouring languages (see the note below).

- The digitisation process for the lists of [Mentawai]{style="color:crimson"} (not the "1933" one), [Nias (1905 and 1911)]{style="color:crimson"}, [Salang and Sigule]{style="color:crimson"}, [Sigulei and Salang]{style="color:crimson"}, and [Seumalur]{style="color:crimson"} was conducted by [my students](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands?tab=readme-ov-file#student-contributors) at the English Lexicology and Lexicography course in the Bachelor of English Literature, Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University. This is part of a [class project](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands) to introduce the *WeSay* software to the students.

    - UPDATE: The .sfm plain-text files from the WeSay projects are to be further processed (particularly matching the main word list with the notes)
