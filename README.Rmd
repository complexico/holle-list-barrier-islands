## Overview

A repository hosting (a work-in-progress for) the digitised and curated [dataset of the Holle List](https://github.com/Holle-List) vocabularies of [languages off the west coast of Sumatra](https://www.indonesianlanguages.org/home/barrier-islands-languages/), Indonesia [@holle1987; @holleli1980]. The goal is to allow computational matching between the vocabularies of these languages with the [main, digitised Holle List](https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/) [@rajeg2023]. The matching will provide the English, Dutch, and Indonesian translations for these vocabularies that are carried over from the main Holle List.

Please [cite](https://github.com/complexico/holle-list-barrier-islands/blob/main/CITATION.cff) this repository and the presentation about the project [@rajeg_ds_2025] as follows:

### Notes

Files below inside the `plaintexts` directory have been digitised and manually checked:

  - lekon.txt (✅)
    
  - simalur.txt (✅)
    
  - tapah.txt (✅)
    
  - mentawai1933.txt (✅)

These files will be supplemented with the following additional data from the neighbouring languages.

- The digitisation for $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Mentawai}}$ (not the "1933" one) ([page](https://github.com/Holle-List/mentawai-nd-holle-list)), $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Nias (1905 and 1911)}}$, $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Salang and Sigule}}$, $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Sigulei and Salang}}$, and $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Seumalur (NBG 1912)}}$ ([page](https://github.com/Holle-List/seumalur1912-holle-list)) was conducted by [my students](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands?tab=readme-ov-file#student-contributors) as part of the English Lexicology and Lexicography course in the Bachelor of English Literature program, Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University. This is part of a [class project](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands) to introduce *WeSay* to the students.

#### Updates from students' works

- The [Seumalur (NBG 1912)](https://github.com/Holle-List/seumalur1912-holle-list) list has been published ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.25446/oxford.30924731))
    
- The [Mentawai (not the "1933")](https://github.com/Holle-List/mentawai-nd-holle-list) list has been published ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.25446/oxford.30928769)) 

- The [Nias (NBG 1905)](https://github.com/Holle-List/nias1905-holle-list) list has been published ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.25446/oxford.30978940))

- The [Nias (1911)](https://github.com/Holle-List/nias1905-holle-list) list has been published ([DOI](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18128740))

- Two more lists to be proofread (`Salang and Sigule` and `Sigulei and Salang`)
