## Overview

A repository hosting (a work-in-progress for) the digitised and curated dataset of the Holle List vocabularies of languages off the west coast of Sumatra, Indonesia [@holle1987; @holleli1980]. The goal is to allow computational matching between the vocabularies of these languages with the [main, digitised Holle List](https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/) [@rajeg2023]. The matching will provide the English, Dutch, and Indonesian translations for these vocabularies that are carried over from the main Holle List.

### Notes

- Files in the `plaintexts` directory below have been digitised and manually checked:

    - lekon.txt (✅)
    
    - simalur.txt (✅)
    
    - tapah.txt (✅)
    
    - mentawai1933.txt (✅)

These files will be supplemented by the remaining additional data from the neighbouring languages (see the note below).

- The digitisation for $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Mentawai}}$ (not the "1933" one), $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Nias (1905 and 1911)}}$, $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Salang and Sigule}}$, $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Sigulei and Salang}}$, and $\textcolor{crimson}{\textsf{Seumalur}}$ was conducted by [my students](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands?tab=readme-ov-file#student-contributors) as part of the English Lexicology and Lexicography course in the Bachelor of English Literature program, Faculty of Humanities, Udayana University. This is part of a [class project](https://github.com/complexico/lexico-holle-list-barrier-islands) to introduce *WeSay* to the students.
