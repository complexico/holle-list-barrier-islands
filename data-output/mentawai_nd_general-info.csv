,"Mentawei - dialect of the Page islands and Sipora. 
The language, a sample of which is given in this list is spoken on the two Page islands, on Sipora (Sikobu), and on the south-eastern part of Sabirut. A dialect which is closely related to the one presented here is reported to be spoken in the Papajet region of Simatalun (the south-west<ern part> of the large island). The language spoken in the northern part of the island (in Tabekad and Simalegi) seems to be more different, but the interpreters in Muara Sabirut (all but one are Batak) say that the speakers of the two dialects can understand each other if they speak slowly.",Other Details,1.2.1.
